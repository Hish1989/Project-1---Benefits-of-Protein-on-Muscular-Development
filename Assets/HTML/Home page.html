        <p>Protein is essential for the maintance and growth of muscles throughout an exercise program. Without protein, muscles would repair would be insufficient, increasing
            risk of injury, and muscular development, particularly regarding size, would not achieve desired outcomes. It is therefore important to understand what
            protein is and how to reap the benefits of it in order to maintain and build muscles and achieve desired outcomes from a gym program.
