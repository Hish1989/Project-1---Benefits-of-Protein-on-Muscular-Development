            <h2>An introduction to protein</h2>
            <p>Protein is essential for a number of functions including growth, brain development, healthy bones and the production of hormones. Proteins are made up of 
                    'building blocks' called amino acids. There are 22 amino acids in total of which eight (or ten for children) are termed essential because we cannot make 
                    them in our bodies and so have to get them from the food we eat. Proteins are divided into two groups: animal and plant. Animal proteins, such as meat, cheese
                    and eggs are sometimes referred to as primary proteins as they contain all eight essential amino acids and are considered to be the most important ones for
                    growth. Plant foods rich in proteins include pulses, legumes, lentils, tofu and other soya products. As delicious and nutritious as these foods are, they 
                    are referred to as incomplete proteins because they don't contain all of the essential amino acids. However, as long as a varied, plant-based diet is eaten, 
                    vegetarians should have no problem achieving their protein requirements.

            <h2>Protein structure and variety</h2>
            <p>Proteins are composed of chains of amino acids. A typical protein is about 400 amino acids long. As there are 20 different types of naturally occurring amino acids,
             many different proteins can be made. Different proteins are made of different combinations of amino acids.

            The sequence of amino acids in the chain determines how the chain will fold up to make the protein, so different proteins have different three-dimensional shapes. The three-dimensional shape of a
             protein determines its function. This is because proteins form attachments and interact with many other molecules and structures inside organisms. The shape of a protein determines what it can interact
             with, just like the shape of a key determines which locks it can operate.
