        <H2>Gaining Muscle</H2>
        <p>Meeting the daily recommended protein intake may help you maintain muscle mass and strength. This is important for maintaining your ability to walk and 
            reducing your risk of injury from falls. The amino acids that makeup protein are the building blocks of muscle. Your body can manufacture many of those 
            amino acids, but nine are known as essential amino acids (EAA) because they can’t be made in the body. Instead, you have to consume EAAs from food sources
            like meat, beans, nuts, and soy. A diet containing mixed amino acids can help maximize muscle protein synthesis.To maintain muscle mass, it’s important for
            older people to eat protein ‘effectively’. This means consuming high-quality protein foods, such as lean meats. .Protein is the foundation of muscle gain. 
            This essential component is a necessity for all of your body’s daily functions and uses. Despite myths and misconceptions surrounding how much protein you
            should or should not eat, it’s important to balance one’s protein accrual with the rest of their nutritional 
            intake. Soon after exercising, it’s recommended that you have a serve of high-quality protein (such as a glass of milk or tub of yoghurt) with a carbohydrate
            meal to help maintain your body’s protein balance. Studies have shown this is good for you, even after low to moderate aerobic exercise (such as walking), 
            particularly for older adults. People who exercise vigorously or are trying to put on muscle mass do not need to consume extra protein. High-protein diets do 
            not lead to increased muscle mass. It’s the stimulation of muscle tissue through exercise, not extra dietary protein, which leads to muscle growth. Studies show that weight-trainers who do not eat extra protein (either in food or protein powders) still gain muscle at the same rate as weight-trainers who 
            supplement their diets with protein.</p>

        <h2>Quantity of Protein needed</h2>   
        <p>In a study published in the Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition, researchers compared the muscle development of three groups of athletes 
            on the same exercise regimen, but different levels of protein intake.  One group was given less than the daily recommended amount (1.4g/kg of body weight), 
            one group the recommended level (1.8g/kg of body weight), and one group over the daily recommended level (2.0kg/ of body weight). The researchers found no 
            recorded benefit in strength or body composition changes in the group that exceeded the recommended amount of protein needed for strength training.  They found that 0.8 – 0.9 grams per pound of bodyweight was sufficient to see favorable changes in body composition.
            Let’s say you weigh 125 pounds, and you’re working to increase your Lean Body Mass.  You would need to set a target of about 100 grams. 100 grams might seem like a lot, but consider that 1 cup (140 grams) of chicken contains 43 grams of protein.  That’s just the protein in just one part of just one meal in your day.  A can of tuna can contain as much as 49 grams.  With a cup of chicken and a can of tuna, you’d almost entirely meet your protein needs.  Add in a glass of 2% milk (9-10 grams), and you’re well over 100 grams for the day.
            If you want to build muscle, increase your dietary protein intake– but protein is not the only macronutrient responsible for muscle growth. Protein automatically gets the credit for building strong muscles, but let’s not forget about your carb intake.
